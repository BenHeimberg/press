# Setup

```
npm install @nuxt/press --save
```

```
yarn add @nuxt/press
```

This will also install Nuxt if you haven't yet. If you haven't defined a 
`scripts` section in your package.json file, one will automatically be added 
with all `@nuxt/press` commands.

If you haven't created a `nuxt.config.js` file yet, one will be created for you
with `modules` filled out for you:

```js
export default {
  modules: ['@nuxt/press']
}
```
